# Final Year Project

Title: MyUni Planner System

Description:
A mobile application specifically built to help UNIMAS students keep track of each event related to
academic development and growth. This project may also help students to easily access any
announcements, news, assignments, and tasks anywhere and in any environment. Besides, all
information from various platforms or websites is incorporated into one software platform which
helps to alleviate the workload of university personnel to update the information with one
platform.
